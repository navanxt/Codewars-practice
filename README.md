# Codewars-practice

### This repo consists of all the programs that I did in https://www.codewars.com

1. Beginner series #1 School paperwork :
Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.
Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need.

2. Beginner series #2 Clock :
Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.
Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to milliseconds.

3. Beginner series #3 Sum of numbers :
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

4. Beginner series #4 Cockroach :
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

5. Beginner series #5 Triangular numbers :
Triangular number is the amount of points that can fill equilateral triangle. Given a number 'T' from interval [1; 2147483646], find if it is triangular number or not.

6. Find the first non-consecutive number :
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.If the whole array is consecutive then return 'None'.

7. Take the derivative :
This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.
Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like ax^b).

8. Expressions matter :
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained.
