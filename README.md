 Codewars-practice

### This repo consists of all the programs that I did in https://www.codewars.com

1. Beginner series #1 School paperwork :
Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.
Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need.

2. Beginner series #2 Clock :
Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.
Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to milliseconds.

3. Beginner series #3 Sum of numbers :
Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

4. Beginner series #4 Cockroach :
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

5. Beginner series #5 Triangular numbers :
Triangular number is the amount of points that can fill equilateral triangle. Given a number 'T' from interval [1; 2147483646], find if it is triangular number or not.

6. Find the first non-consecutive number :
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.If the whole array is consecutive then return 'None'.

7. Take the derivative :
This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.
Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an expression (like ax^b).

8. Expressions matter :
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained.

9. Total amount of points :
Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match: if x>y - 3 points, if x<y - 0 point, if x=y - 1 point.

10. Abbreviate a two word name :
Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

11. Array plus array :
Get the sum of two arrays, ie, the sum of all their elements. P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

12. Sum of positive :
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones. If there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

13. You only need one :
You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value. Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

14. Is the string uppercase :
Create a method is_uppercase() to see whether the string is ALL CAPS. In this Kata, a string is said to be in ALL CAPS whenever it does not contain any lowercase letter so any string containing no letters at all is trivially considered to be in ALL CAPS.

15. Is it even :
In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function. Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not). The function needs to return either a true or false. Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats. Floats are considered UNeven for this kata.

16. Will you make it? :
You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not. Function should return true (1 in Prolog) if it is possible and false (0 in Prolog) if not. The input values are always positive.

17. Is he gonna survive? :
A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

18. Watermelon :
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy watermelons. They chose the biggest crate. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide their loot, however they faced a hard problem.
Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the number of watermelons in such a way that each of the two parts consists of an even number of watermelons. However, it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, whether they can divide the fruits in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight. Given an integral number of watermelons w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100; 1 ≤ w in Haskell), check whether Pete and Billy can divide the melons so that each of them gets an even amount.
